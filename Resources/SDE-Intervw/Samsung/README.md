- Company S has developed an industrial endoscope available to explore inner part of the decrepit water pipes.
  It is possible to explore the inner part of the pipes putting the endoscope in a certain part of the pipe.
  The endoscope can be moved in the pipe only. Meanwhile, when the pipes are connected, if the length of the endoscope is long enough to explore,  then it can inspect the connected pipes. However, we cannot observe every pipe because the length of the endoscope is limited.

  When the map of the ground water pipe, the location where the endoscope to out in, and the length of the endoscope is given, calculate the number of pipe which are available to explore. Length of endoscope means the range upto which endoscope can explore. There are seven kind of pipes, and description for each pipe are shown below:

   When the map of the groundwater pipe, the location where the endoscope to out in, and the length of the endoscope is given, calculate the number of the pipe which are available to explore. Length of endoscope means the range up to which endoscope can explore.
     #### Input
     In the first line, T, the number of total test cases are given. From the second line, T test cases are given. In the first line of each test case, N, the height of the map of the groundwater pipes, M, the width, R, the vertical location of the water pipe where to put in the endoscope, C, the horizontal location of it, and the length of the endoscope L are given. In the following N lines, information about the map of the groundwater pipe is given. Each line has M numbers. Each number (from 1 to 7) means the type of water pipe for that point. 0 means there is no water pipe buried in that place.

     #### Output
     Print the respective answer for T test cases in total for T lines. The answer is the number of water pipes which is available to observe using the endoscope.

     #### Constraints

- Given a graph print either of the set of the vertices that are colored with the same color. And if the graph is not bipartite print “-1”. Test cases also included cases when a graph is not connected.

- You’ll be given a grid as below:
     ```
                            0 1 0 2 0 --> Non highlighted part
                            0 2 2 2 1
                            0 2 1 1 1
                            1 0 1 0 0
                            0 0 1 2 2
                            1 1 0 0 1
                            x x S x x  -->highlighted yellow
     ```
       In the grid above,     
    1: This cell has a coin.  
    2: This cell has an enemy.    
    0: It contains nothing.     
    The highlighted(yellow) zone is the control zone. S is a spaceship that we need to control so that we can get maximum coins.      
    Now, S’s initial position will be at the center and we can only move it right or left by one cell or do not move.
    At each time, the non-highlighted part of the grid will move down by one unit.    
    We can also use a bomb but only once. If we use that, all the enemies in the 5×5 region above the control zone will be killed.  
    If we use a bomb at the very beginning, the grid will look like this:
   ```
   0 1 0 2 0  --> Non highlighted part
   0 0 0 0 1
   0 0 1 1 1
   1 0 1 0 0
   0 0 1 0 0
   1 1 0 0 1
   x x S x x  --> highlighted yellow
     ```
       As soon as, the spaceship encounters an enemy or the entire grid has come down, the game ends.     
      For example,    
      At the very first instance, if we want to collect a coin we should move left **( coins=1)**. This is because when the grid comes down by 1 unit we have a coin on the second position and by moving left we can collect that coin. Next, we should move right to collect another coin **( coins=2)** .
      After this, remain at the same position **( coins=4)**.
      This is the current situation after collecting 4 coins.
     ```
   0 1 0 2 0                0 1 0 0 0
  0 2 2 2 1 -->after using 0 0 0 0 1
  x x S x x -->bomb        x x S x x
   ```
 Now, we can use the bomb to get out of this situation. After this, we can collect at most 1 coin. So maximum coins=5.
- A Research team want to establish a research center in a region where they found some rare-elements.They want to make it closest to all the rare-elements as close as possible so that they can reduce overall cost of research over there.

- Given a graph question. We have to find the loop in the graph if it exists and print the nodes of the loop in sorted order.

- You are given an old touch smartphone numbers having dial pad and calculator app.
  The goal is to type a number on dial-pad.
  Calculator have 1-9 and +, -, \* , /, = as operations. But as the phone is old, some of the numbers and some operations can't be touched.
  But you can always make a number using other numbers and operations. There could be multiple ways of making a number. You have to find minimum operation for making a number.  
  For ex: lets say 1,4,6,7,8,9 works and +,-,* works.
  2,3,5 and / doesn't work.     
  If you have to type 18-> 2 operations. (Each touch is considered an operation).    
  If you have to type 5 -> '1+4=' that requires 4 operations. There could be other ways to make '5'.  
    The goal is to find minimum operations.

- There are N pots. Every pot has some water in it. They may be partially filled. Every pot is associated with overflow number O which tell how many minimum no. of stones required for that pot to overflow. The crow knows O1 to On(overflow no. for all the pots). Crow wants some K pots to be overflow. So the task is a minimum number of stones he can make K pots overflow in the worst case.

    Array of overflow no--. {1,...,On}   
    Number of pots--n     
    No of pots to overflow-- k

    Let say two pots are there with overflow no.s {5,58}, and the crow has to overflow one pot(k=1). So crow will put 5 stones in a pot with overflow no.(58), it will not overflow, then he will put in the pot with overflow no.(5), hence the total no. of stones to make overflow one-pot is=10.

- You are given 2 convex hulls. Find all the common points that lie in the intersection of these 2 convex hulls.

- There is one spaceship. X and Y co-ordinate of the source of spaceship and destination spaceship is given. There is N number of wormholes; each wormhole has 5 values.
  First 2 values are starting co-ordinate of the wormhole and after that value no. 3 and 4 represent ending co-ordinate of the wormhole and last 5th value is represents a cost to pass through this wormhole. Now, these warmholes are bi-directional.
  Now the to go from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) is abs(x1-x2)+abs(y1-y2).
  The main problem here is to find the minimum distance to reach spaceship from source to destination co-ordinate using any number of warm-hole. It is ok if you won't uses any warmhole.
- There is an island surrounded by oil mines. You will be given n companies and m oil mines having values. You have to distribute the mines to "n" companies in fair manner. Remember the companies can have oil mines adjacent to each other and not in between of each other.After distributing them compute the difference of oil mines from the company getting highest and company getting lowest. This number should be minimum.(then only the distribution can be termed as fair).


        Example
        Input
        2
        2 4
        6 13 10 2
        2 4
        6 10 13 2

        output

-  There is a n x n matrix with only 0s & 1s. Letters are formed using 1 and 0.
      For eg.-
      
              
              
                   U is 1 0 1,  V is 1 0 1
                        1 0 1        1 0 1
                        1 1 1        0 1 0  
                        
              
              
    Likewise there are 6 letters and they can rotated in 90, 180, 270, 360 degree. And if there is a letter, the next column would be  filled with 0.
                Eg. 
                
                
                
                    V- 1 0 1 0
                       1 0 1 0
                       0 1 0 0
                       
                
                
    So we have to count the number of each letter in the matrix.

- Write a program to append a C-style string to the end of another C-style string. You were supposed to
write a function like void concat(char* a , char* b) such that after calling this function a becomes
a+b(concatenation of a and b). Assume that size of a is greater than length of a+length of b.No
library functions were to be used. Not even strlen.

- Stack pointer vs Frame pointer.
- Explain spooling.
- You are given a process A. The scheduler is using Priority Based Round Robin Technique for
scheduling various process. Suppose at some instant A was being run and it entered its critical
section. And there it acquired a resource X. Meanwhile another process B comes to the ready
queue. B has more priority than A. Now the preemption occurs and scheduler decides to run B and it
also wants t own resource X to complete some task. Now B won’t be able to take the resource as A
is already having it but since it has higher priority it must run before A. So is this condition a
deadlock? Explain with reasons.
