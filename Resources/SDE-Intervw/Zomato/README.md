<b name="coding">Coding round questions</b><br/>
- Find total number of set bit in numbers upto n.
- Reverse the each word of the given paragraph.
- WAP to find height of BST.
- Form the maximum number from the elements of the array.
- Detect if two line segments intersect each other.
- Write a code for a 2-D array such that it there’s a zero, it overwrites all the elements of the corresponding row and column as zero.
- Write a code to find the previous shorter element in an array.
- Given a world map such that all the places covered via land are represented by ‘L’ and rest by ‘W’. Since world is spherical hence rows and columns are cyclic (before row 1 row n comes and after row n row 1 same for column). Count the number of islands.

<i><u name="dbms">DBMS</u></i>
- What is indexing and how is it implemented internally.
- Given two DBs A and B and one table T ( Columns C1, C2)in both DBs, C1 was primary key in them and C2 was another indexed column in DB B. Select query will run on both DBs i.e Select C2 from T where C1=X. Which DB will serve faster data?
