Just wanted to share this AWESOME VUE UI library I found: https://vuematerial.io/
One of the best ones I found so far - even if you dislike the looks of Material Design, it is relatively easy to reskin all the elements to your desired needs.

So if you like VUE - give it a try!

A wonder UI framework for Vue done in Material style, but relatively easily re-skinable via CSS if needed to be: https://quasar.dev/

Out of all UI frameworks I tried in different frameworks, this one wins hands down for me.
I heavily suggest giving it a go.

VSCode shortcuts that you should try out

These shortcuts have really changed how i work in VSCode
and i think everyone who's working a lot with VSCode should at least know about these.

Symbols are variables, functions, classes etc...

Ctrl + ...

T: Search for symbols in your entire workspace
Shift + O: Search for symbols in the current file
P: Search for file in workspace (you can append a :row or even :row:column, you also don't have to type out the full name, it will jump into the top search result)
Shift + P: Search for any command (also great for learning shortcuts!)
G: Jump to line
J: Open / close the bottom panel
`: Toggle integrated terminal
Shift + `: Open new integrated terminal
Shift + Space: Trigger parameter hints
Shift + N: New window
W: Close current file
B: Toggle sidebar
Q: Quick Open View
Shift + F: Show search (for searching in your entire workspace)
T: Open new editor
Shift + T: Open previously closed editor(s)
,: Open settings
K -> Ctrl + S: Open keyboard shortcuts

PS: On German keyboards ` is ö
PPS: A lot of these shortcuts stem from the shortcuts browser made popular, like the tab shortcuts (others like Ctrl + Tab also work!)

Even better, Quixel Megascans has been free for a while for UE4 users: https://quixel.com/megascans/home
and prices were slashed for non UE4 users as well
Quixel Mixer is useful for combining/editing Megascans assets
If you want to do texturing, you should use the far better Substance Painter

Single line description of project:
Rhythm game similar to FoF(ix), GH, or RB.
Progress to completion:
Currently have basic groundwork set but not everything is in the best of shape.
Basic buggy 2d renderer(In the process of updating it).
Basic chart midi chart loading.
Audio system is progressing.
I'm aiming to have a very basic playable prototype version before the end of the year.
Detailed description:
Rhythm game similar to FoF/FoFiX, Phase Shift, GH, or RB. There are plenty of other rhythm games out there in this vain, however they are either platform restricted(not available on PC), buggy and not easily extendable, or no longer developed. I've also identified many technical issues with the various PC available games and aim to not have those problems. I am trying to set a new bar for a free RB/GH style rhythm game. The game will also be quite themeable allowing users to customize the game's looks to their liking.

LCLTuples
Main Language(s):

Any additional libraries or overhead:
None
Single line description of project:
A simple yet powerful Java tuples library
Detailed Description:
The library contains both imutable and mutable tuples with sizes from one to ten. All tuples have a base class and are type-safe, iterable, serializable and implement hashCode(), toString() and equals(Object). You will find a more detailed description on the repository page. 
Process to completion:
The library can be used in its current form. I'm open to suggestions and improvements. A refractoring is possible in the future though I will try not to break existing code. I want to maybe add abstractions for all tuple types and possibly make a system in which you can create your own tuples and integrate them with the library.

I want to run some benchmarks for and see just how much positive effect HTTP/2 really has, which is why I wrote it (in C). There aren't many HTTP/2 implementations out there (there's only 3 main ones written in C that are open source, and they are all monoliths) so it was also a goal to keep the code relatively simple and easy to understand, perhaps in the hopes that people could use my implementation for educational purposes.

Main Language: Python 3.6 (might be able to go lower, haven't tested)
Single line description: This is a top level socket library, making servers and clients EASY! 
Progress to completion: Done, need to finish docs
Detailed Description: This is a top-level API for creating server and client socket servers. Designed to be easy to use, quick-connect uses events (such as pyee) to trigger callbacks. A server may send an event to a client, or vise versa. Great for chat programs, games, and handling massive amounts of clients!

mindstorm8191 — 03/15/2018
Project Name: DanIdle
Main Languages(s): Javascript/Web tools, jQuery
Any additional libraries or overhead: Tippy (for tooltips) and other small add-on libraries as needed
Single line description of project: An idle-ish game climbing a tech tree
Progress to completion: maybe 5%? Depends on how much actually gets added
Detailed description:  So much planned, but not a lot built yet. The game starts you out with nothing but sticks and 4 workers. You climb up a tech tree while also expanding your population by way of food, housing, clothes, safety measures, etc.  So far you can hunt, make flint tools and start mining for copper (that part is about to be rebuilt). I'm hoping to have powered tools soon, and lots of machines the player must manage that will accelerate play even more.
Repo link: https://github.com/mindstorm8191/danidle
Can I play?: There's a working version of the game at http://bookalong.x10host.com/danidle
How do I play?: If you're finding it hard to start playing, I understand.  Starter instructions / player orientation for the game is something that needs to be added, and I'm open to ideas on how to implement it.  For now there's a beginners guide in the Github's wiki for this game: https://github.com/mindstorm8191/danidle/wiki/Getting-Started
Can I participate?: Yes! I would love to make this a community project. I am open to any suggestions / ideas you might have.  If you would also like to help with coding, there is a list of tasks that need done on my github page, just pick any task you think you can do and go at it.  Feel free to ask me any questions you might have about the source.

Project Name: Dupbit Desktop App
Main Language: Node JS
Libraries: Electron, ws (WebSockets)
Short Description: An app to connect all your devices so they can work flawless together
Progress: The main frame was just completed now there need to be added actual features
Description: The desktop app is a part of a serie of apps that you can use, I'm planning to make a mobile app, browser add-on, ...? that connect to the server which has a frontend website. All those apps are supposed to work together some examples:
• You are listening to a youtube song and your laptop is out of reach, you want to skip a song, you can simply do that by opening the app which sends a next song command to the server. The server detects you are listening on youtube atm and sends a next song command to the browser add-on which will interact with youtube.com
• You are watching a movie in bed on your laptop wich is on your desk for example, you are done watching tv but to lazy to get up to turn your laptop screen off, you pick up your phone and send a command to the server which will send the turn screenoff command to the desktop app.
• ...

Where do I need your help for?: I want to know more annoying situations you encounter in your life which would be able to be fixed with this app so I can implement them.
Can I actually code on the project?: Yes dm me if you want too

Project Name: KUtils
Main language(s): Kotlin
Any additional libraries or overhead: JDA
Single line description of project: A skin over JDA in kotlin for creating discord bots easily. Find examples and explanations on the wiki.
Detailed description: The focus of this project is reducing boilerplate and getting rid of faulty, bad patterns in JDA, for example, the .queue() system. It's pretty clean and works well, but it is still in development thus far. 
Progress to completion: About 65% I would say, I need to modularize command arguments so that they can be added and use in the parser naturally, but a base, usable version is most certainly there.

Project Name: mif-creator
Main language: NodeJS
Single line description of project:  Convert (and compress) images to mif files (Memory Initialisation File)
Detailed description: When using images on a System On Chip designs on a FPGA they need to be initialised in a memory. You can't save them as images directly but need to be converted to their hex values and an address or some other format that your driver uses. With this module you can simply convert them or convert and compress them. 

The compression mode will make 2 mif files where one is a lookup table that only contains the colors that are actually used in the image and a lookup table that contains addresses for the lookup table. By doing this you can save over 90% of the actual size with simple images.
Progress of completion: 100%

Project name: Basic
Main language(s): Python for generation.
Any additional libraries or overhead: No addition libraries required.
Single line description of project: This project is a large resource bringing many languages together and giving useful information for each.
Progress to completion: This repo is never completely finished, we're always subject to more additions. However there is a short TODO list in the README.
Detailed description:
This project was made to give a community resource to any skill level of developer. This project gives an insight to installation, compilation, execution, and an understanding of syntax for a large base of languages. Currently we only support 6 languages (as of time this was written) but will soon be adding much more. This project is meant to be community driven.
We provide many types of projects to showcase each language, we plan on making the projects on base of all different levels. From easy projects (like hello world) to some more complex projects not yet listed. This allows for a place to be referenced for resources and guides for each language.

🔨 WSL3 (Windows iS Linux) — 08/18/2018
Project name: TouchControl
Main language(s): Java and Kotlin
Any additional libraries or overhead: OpenCV
Single line description of project: Control at your fingertips.
Progress to completion: Current build can be considered done. Looking to add more modules.
Detailed description: TouchControl is a sci-fi fantasy come to life. By using a cheap camera and some software trickery, you can control aspects of your system by simply waving your hands around in a target area. Current demos include: MousePad, PianoKey, and VolumeSlider. The code is built in a way that encourages adding modules to the core. The core has been recently converted to Kotlin, but Kotlin knowledge is not required to add modules.

Project name:  Grace.js
Main language(s): Javascript.
Any additional libraries or overhead: At the moment of this post, only Discord.js npm is being used, however, Redis will be included, and also packages for audio stream/processing.
Single line description of project: Simple and intended to have a good performance Discord bot.
Detailed description: Grace.js is a new Discord.js bot using node.js, it only has a few commands that got some local tests so more performance tests/discussions are always welcome, also it's possible to just test the features that the bot already has as I'm hosting it locally(there's a test server in the github repo), not only in coding, suggestions as just a Discord user are welcome too.
The main goal is to keep the coding simple, with a good readability and performance. Take a look :3
