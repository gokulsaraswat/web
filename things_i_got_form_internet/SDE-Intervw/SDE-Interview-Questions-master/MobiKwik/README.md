<b name="coding">Coding round questions</b><br/>
- Given an array of distinct elements, rearrange the elements of an array in zig-zag fashion in O(n) time. The converted array should be in form a < b > c < d > e < f.
-  Find k max in an array and print it.
- Given a rod of length n inches and an array of prices that contains prices of all pieces of size smaller than n. Determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.
- You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount.
- Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.
- Convert string to palindrome string with minimum insertions.
- Given a matrix of n*n. Each cell contain 0, 1, -1. 0 denotes there is no diamond but there is a path. 1 denotes there is a diamond at that location with a path -1 denotes that the path is blocked. Now you have started from 0,0 and reach to the last cell & then return to 0,0 collecting maximum no of diamonds. While going to the last cell you can move only right and down. While returning you can move only left and up.
- Build a super stack.

       Print value of "peak" after each operation.
       n: the number of operations
      POP: get the value of "peak", if there is no more value after the pop,
            then print "EMPTY".
      PUSH d: put the new value(d) after "peak", then print the value of "peak".
      INC x d : add the new value(d) from index 0 to x elements, then print
                the value of "peak".
- Given a graph of connected and unconnected cities and cost for connecting unconnected cities were provided and we were asked to find minimum cost to connect all cities.
