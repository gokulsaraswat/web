# A collection of CSS text-shadow and pattern effects

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/ashleynolan/pen/QwvKaw](https://codepen.io/ashleynolan/pen/QwvKaw).

This pen experiments with some simple text effects you can create using text-shadow and hover transitions.  Iâ€™ve also played around with creating a patterned hover text effect, mixing those effects with a bit of SVG.
