# Sliding Tile Puzzle with Custom Images in Vue

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/collinsworth/pen/MMagLb](https://codepen.io/collinsworth/pen/MMagLb).

A fork of [this original sliding puzzle pen](https://codepen.io/joshuajcollinsworth/pen/XwPXrM); after building the original, I wondered whether I could use custom image URLs and `background-position` to make the same sliding tile puzzle but with images instead of numbers.

There are three image selections, and a custom choice to use your own image URL. There are also some extra options for display and gameplay.
