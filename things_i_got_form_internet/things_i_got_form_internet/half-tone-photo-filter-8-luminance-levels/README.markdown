# Half-tone Photo filter: 8 Luminance Levels

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/mullany/pen/DqlKc](https://codepen.io/mullany/pen/DqlKc).

This SVG filter will generate an 8 level half-tone from an image based on a 3x3 grid. It relies on feImage object import so it does not work on Firefox.
