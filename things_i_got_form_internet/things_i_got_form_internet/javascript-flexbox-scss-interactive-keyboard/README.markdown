# JavaScript/Flexbox/SCSS Interactive Keyboard

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/collinsworth/pen/VPXVbW](https://codepen.io/collinsworth/pen/VPXVbW).

After day 1 of Wes Bos's #JavaScript30 challenge (https://javascript30.com) I wanted to create my own pen that took advantage of JavaScript keydown event listeners. This was the result. NOTE: Apparently doesn't work in Safari, as Safari seems to block certain inputs.
