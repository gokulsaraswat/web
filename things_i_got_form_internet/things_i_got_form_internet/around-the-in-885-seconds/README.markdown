A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/dilums/pen/YzGYQNy](https://codepen.io/dilums/pen/YzGYQNy).

Inspired by the [Animated World Zoom](https://www.jasondavies.com/maps/zoom/), I wanted to try out rotate and zoom animations with GSAP easing.  
Some of the code and Versor class is from Mike Bostocks notebook [World Tour](https://observablehq.com/@d3/world-tour)
