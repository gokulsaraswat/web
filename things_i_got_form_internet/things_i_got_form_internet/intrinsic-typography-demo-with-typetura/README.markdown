# Intrinsic Typography demo with Typetura

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/scottkellum/pen/poNXLYV](https://codepen.io/scottkellum/pen/poNXLYV).

This is a demo of intrinsic typography for an upcoming article. All the text styles are fluidly interpolated as the element sizes change without any breakpoints or media queries. As a result of this method of typesetting, all the headlines on the page can be driven by a single style and the page can scale from the size of a watch up to the size of a TV while still remaining clear and legible.
