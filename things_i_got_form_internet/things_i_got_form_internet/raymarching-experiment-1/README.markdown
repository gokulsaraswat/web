# Raymarching Experiment #1

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/MillerTime/pen/WNjpYpJ](https://codepen.io/MillerTime/pen/WNjpYpJ).

Experimenting with raymarched signed distance fields (SDFs).

I setup a shadertoy-esque playground and started tinkering with the idea of slicing through an object with a complex interior. The result turned out fairly abstract and I ended up building some custom materials, notably the "gem" has an animated, partially emissive texture that plays nicely with reflections.

The article that made raymarching click for me was the following, and I heavily borrowed code from the examples.
