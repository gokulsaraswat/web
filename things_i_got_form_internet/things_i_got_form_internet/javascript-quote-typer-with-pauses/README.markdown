# JavaScript Quote Typer with Pauses

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/collinsworth/pen/baLLvp](https://codepen.io/collinsworth/pen/baLLvp).

A bit of vanilla JavaScript to type out quotes as though a human were manning the keyboard (with random keystroke intervals). 

Includes pauses for emphasis after a period, semicolon, or comma.

JavaScript section has comments explaining how to change the quote and use this functionality in your own code.
