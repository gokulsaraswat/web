# Stack game with Three.js and Cannon.js

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/HunorMarton/pen/MWjBRWp](https://codepen.io/HunorMarton/pen/MWjBRWp).

Build a stack of boxes. Boxes are coming in from left and right and you have to click when the incoming box is on top of the previous one. You have to be precise though because the overhanging parts will fall down and the surface you can place boxes on gets smaller and smaller. 

If you want to learn how to build this game, check out my tutorial on Three.js and Cannon.js: https://youtu.be/hBiGFpBle7E

In the tutorial, we go through the source code of this game. We cover, how to set up a Three.js scene with box objects, how to add lights, how to set up the camera, how to add animation and event handlers, and finally, we add physics simulation with Cannon.js.

This game was heavily inspired by [Stack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.stack&hl=en&gl=US).
