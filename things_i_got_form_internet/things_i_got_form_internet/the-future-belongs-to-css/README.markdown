A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/collinsworth/pen/aEJGvg](https://codepen.io/collinsworth/pen/aEJGvg).

Just a fun, pure CSS exploration of some newer or less common CSS features, including CSS Grid, Flexbox, position: sticky, and Sass (for the random colors and a couple other niceties).
