# Variable Font Generative Letter Grid

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/collinsworth/pen/ZEGrMRQ](https://codepen.io/collinsworth/pen/ZEGrMRQ).

Just a fun generative typography experiment with a couple of variable fonts. Hover over a square and the weight (and color, optionally) will slowly change. Click to change the character. Features a few custom settings to play with.

Built with Sass and Vue; fonts are Playfair Display and Muli (both available on Google Fonts).
