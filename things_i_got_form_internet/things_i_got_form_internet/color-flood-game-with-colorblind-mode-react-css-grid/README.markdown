# Color Flood Game with Colorblind Mode (React + CSS Grid)

A challenge to make the familiar color flood grid game in-browser. I used React, but if I were doing it over, it might make more sense to just do this in vanilla JS.

The  basic game works, though, and includes a fun emoji-based colorblind mode (which I always personally appreciate). You can change the "size" constant to edit the board size, or uncomment/add colors in the main GameBoard component's state.

PS the color distribution is 100% random so you could get very lucky with an simple game or very unlucky with an extremely complex game. Also, it's probably not fully accessible; just accessible for colorblind users.
